 <p> We used a genetic algorithm to determine the topology of our participant-specific models. 
     The base model on which the genetic algorithm iterated is below along withthe final CNN topology and chosen parameters for each 
     participant's model: </p>

    where N is the number of neurons. There is a maxpool layer in between every active Convolutional layer. There is also the possibility
    for up to two dense layers. The final activation will lead to a single neuron"></center>

    Participant 1's model contains three convolutional layers and one dense layer. 
    The covolutional layers have a tanh activation and 16 neurons, a selu activation and 256 neuron, "></center>
